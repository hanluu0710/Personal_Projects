    <h1 class="sub_head">Technically...</h1>
    <p class="brief">My technical aspiration has always been 
        environmental and sustainablity centric. Other than the 
        projects from different ECE courses, all the work that 
        I do revolve around the environment and building sustainable
        solutions.

                One of my first projects as a member is designing 
                the nickel sheets for the new battery configuration. 
                By changing the configuration from 29s10p to 36s8p,
                not only that we made the module symmetrical (saving space and weight on the car),
                we also increased the total pack voltage by 23% (allowing more torque in the motor).

                <br>
                One of my first projects as a lead was to configure the new motor controller. 
                This is not the most technical project, but it forced me to learn more about the motor,
                and its power consumption, which eventually explains a lot when it comes to current ratings of our system.

                Project Description:
                A portable oscilloscope (with PCB and independent power supply) designed for 
                ease of transport and quick troubleshooting. 
                It can measure the voltage up to 30V, ranging from -15V to +15V. 
                Furthermore, it shows waveforms at the frequency of 1kHz 
                and can take functions with up to 500kbs sample rate, 
                making it ideal for audio, sensor, and low-frequency digital uses.
