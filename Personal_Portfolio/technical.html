    <p class="brief">My technical aspiration has always been 
        environmental and sustainablity centric. Other than the 
        projects from different ECE courses, all the work that 
        I do revolve around the environment and building sustainable
        solutions.

                One of my first projects as a member is designing 
                the nickel sheets for the new battery configuration. 
                By changing the configuration from 29s10p to 36s8p,
                not only that we made the module symmetrical (saving space and weight on the car),
                we also increased the total pack voltage by 23% (allowing more torque in the motor).

                <br>
                One of my first projects as a lead was to configure the new motor controller. 
                This is not the most technical project, but it forced me to learn more about the motor,
                and its power consumption, which eventually explains a lot when it comes to current ratings of our system.

                <br>
                I created a standard of operation to test Mikro's combined overcurrent and earth fault relay
                after engaging with the R&D testing technicians. To learned about the importance of the accuracy in "immediate" tripping time 
                as well as high current saturation testing to make sure that the relay will effectively isolate before breaking due to extreme overcurrent cases.

                I created a power supply PCB with a given schematic using Altium.
                The board was for a voltage relay. Therefore, I had to adhere to all
                EMC rules regarding high-voltage spacing and how to effectively space things out
                to save on area.

                in place of passive filters. I also learned how to size capacitor bank for 
                a system as well. However, I did not have enough time to actually implement these
                into a running porject.

                Reflection:
                The project's original scope was to harvest energy generated by this technology to charge
                phones, batteries,...However, with the effeciency of under 10% and low power (in the miliWatt range) generated due to 
                low current, most of that power was lost before we could use it. Therefore, the project scope was narrowed to a
                zero-power sensor which is a lot more doable while still maintaining practicality.

                Project Description:
                A portable oscilloscope (with PCB and independent power supply) designed for 
                ease of transport and quick troubleshooting. 
                It can measure the voltage up to 30V, ranging from -15V to +15V. 
                Furthermore, it shows waveforms at the frequency of 1kHz 
                and can take functions with up to 500kbs sample rate, 
                making it ideal for audio, sensor, and low-frequency digital uses.
